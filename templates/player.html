I've been alone with you inside my mind <br>
And in my dreams I've kissed your lips a thousand times <br>
I sometimes see you pass outside my door <br>
Hello, is it me you're looking for?<br>
I can see it in your eyes, I can see it in your smile <br>
You're all I've ever wanted and my arms are open wide <br>
'Cause you know just what to say, and you know just what to do <br>
And I want to tell you so much, I love you <br>
I long to see the sunlight in your hair <br>
And tell you time and time again how much I care <br>
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow <br>
Hello, I've just got to let you know <br>
'Cause I wonder where you are and I wonder what you do <br>
Are you somewhere feeling lonely or is someone loving you? <br>
Tell me how to win your heart, for I haven't got a clue <br>
But let me start by saying, I love you <br>

Hello, is it me you're looking for? <br>
Is it me, is it me, is it me <br>
Is it me you're looking for? <br>
Is it me, is it me <br>
